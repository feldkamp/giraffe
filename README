giraffe

  provides functionality for angular cross-correlation analysis
  the underlying classes may also be used for more general purposes

  The classes in this package are the following
    CrossCorrelator --- a class to compute angular auto- and cross-correlations
    arraydata --- a general class for dynamically allocated array (parent class)
    array1D --- derived class for one-dimensional arrays
    array2D --- derived class for two-dimensional arrays
    array3D --- derived class for three-dimensional arrays

  The giraffe library can be used, for example in Anton Barty's cheetah

*** building ***
  This package can be built using the SCons software construction tool (http://www.scons.org/) to yield
    libgiraffe_static.a --- static library
    libgiraffe_dynamic.so/dylib --- dynamic library (extension is platform dependent)
    xcca --- stand-alone tool for X-ray Cross Correlation Analysis
    testsuite --- a bunch of test functions for the classes contained 

*** main contributors ***
  Jan M. Feldkamp, SLAC

*** note on edf support ***
  the code in edf_support is borrowed and slightly altered for this package
  origin: 'matlib' package, hosted at ISP/TUD
